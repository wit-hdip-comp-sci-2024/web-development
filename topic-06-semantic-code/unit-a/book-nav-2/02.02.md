# Semantic Elements

This is the current version of the header and footer partials:

###  header.njk

~~~
<div id="header">
  <h1>Welcome to the App Bundle Store</h1>
</div>
~~~

###  footer.njk
~~~
<div id="footer">
  <p> Contact us at : bundle@store.com, or visit us: <a href="directions.html"> directions </a></p>
</div>
~~~

These elements have a clear role - and the html specification provides elements for these:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header>
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer>

Here is a revised version of these partials using these elements:


###  header.njk

~~~html
<header id="header">
  <h1> Welcome to the App Bundle Store </h1>
</header>
~~~

###  footer.njk
~~~html
<footer id="footer">
  <p> Contact us at : bundle@store.com, or visit us: <a href="directions.html"> directions</a> </p>
</footer>
~~~

Replace these partials in your project now and inspect the results in the browser. These changes do not effect the presentation in any way. They are intended to better reflect the html authors intent.

Here are 3 more of these 'semantic' elements:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main>
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section>
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside>

We can use them in our layout and sidebar, revised as follows:

## layout.njk

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/home.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <main class="container">
      {% include "header.njk" %}
      <section id="maincontent">
        <section id="primary">
          {{ content | safe }}
        </section>
        <aside id="secondary">
          {% include "sidebar.njk" %}
        </aside>
      </section>
      {% include "footer.njk" %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

## sidebar.njk

~~~html
<aside>
  <h1>Weekly Deals</h1>
  <h2 class="special">Business Bundle</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="/images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" class="medium-right-img" /> Here comes the next bundle for
    march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price
    of only €29.99 instead of €199.94. So you can save around 84%.
  </p>
  <h2 class="special">Insanity Deal</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="/images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal" class="medium-left-img" /> With the new €5 Insanity Deals from
    Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app for €5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as
    there are multiple apps for only €5 each, one new per day, for the days to come.
  </p>
</aside>

Reflect on the definitions of the element types above and on how we have used them the these examples. Note that the changes above should not modify the presentation style.
