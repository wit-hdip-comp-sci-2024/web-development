This assumes you have completed lab 05b:

You can use your solution, or download the version above. If you do use this solution, you will need to:

- Extract the archive
- Open a Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to the expanded archive
- Run this command:

~~~
eleventy --serve
~~~

- Open this site in the browser:

- <http://localhost:8080/>
