# Navigation

The `<nav>` section in our site is currently duplicated on each of the main pages:

~~~html
... 
 <nav id="navigation">
   <ul id="menu">
     <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
     <li><a href="/apps">Apps</a></li>
     <li class="active"><a href="/directions">Directions</a></li>
   </ul>
 </nav>
...
~~~

Notice, however, each version has a small difference, the `class=active` is specific to each page. This ensures that the current page title is highlighted in the navigation bar. We would like to find a way of supporting a single nav partial, that can somehow be 'paramaterised' with the correct active element. Eleventy can help us out here with a Navigation "plugin":

- <https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/>

The documentation for this may look a little overwhelming at first. However, the steps below will give you the basics.

The first step is to create a new `nav.njk` partial the **_includes** folder:

### nav.njk

~~~html
 <nav id="navigation">
   <ul id="menu">
     <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
     <li><a href="/apps">Apps</a></li>
     <li><a href="/directions">Directions</a></li>
   </ul>
 </nav>
~~~

In this version we have removed the class `active` for the moment. Here is a revised layout that includes this partial at an appropriate place:

## layout.njk

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/home.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <main class="container">
      {% include "header.njk" %}
      <section id="maincontent">
        <section id="primary">
          {% include "nav.njk" %}      
          {{ content | safe }}
        </section>
        <aside id="secondary">
          {% include "sidebar.njk" %}
        </aside>
      </section>
      {% include "footer.njk" %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

We can now delete the `<nav`> section from our main pages:

### index.njk

This time, although the layout more or less the same, we no longer highlight the active navigation element on any of our pages:

This is where the Navigation plugin will some in (next steps).
