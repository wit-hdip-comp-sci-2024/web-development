# Recap

In this lab we:

* Introduced the playlist page
* Used HTML tables for the first time
* Added songs to our data store
* Used query parameters to pass data between pages
* Introduced eleventy layouts with nunjucks templating with a number of partials

There's a lot here, with exercises along the way, so take your time and make sure you understand the concepts before moving on.
