# Array of Objects and Functions

Continuing with the same data structure we are going to use function driven iteration, finding and filtering of array based data.

```javascript
const playlistCollection = [
  {
    id: "01",
    title: "Beethoven Sonatas",
    songs: [
      {
        id: "04",
        title: "Piano Sonata No. 3",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      },
      {
        id: "05",
        title: "Piano Sonata No. 7",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      },
      {
        id: "06",
        title: "Piano Sonata No. 10",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: "02",
    title: "Beethoven Concertos",
    songs: [
      {
        id: "07",
        title: "Piano Concerto No. 0",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      },
      {
        id: "08",
        title: "Piano Concerto No. 4",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      },
      {
        id: "09",
        title: "Piano Concerto No. 6",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: "03",
    title: "Beethoven Variations",
    songs: [
      {
        id: "10",
        title: "Opus 34: Six variations on a theme in F major",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      },
      {
        id: "11",
        title: "Opus 120: Thirty-three variations on a waltz by Diabelli in C majo",
        artist: "Beethoven",
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

# Exercises

For these exercises, create:

- arrays-08.html
- arrays-08.js

Use this contents for the html file:

## arrays-08.html

```html
<html> 
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Test Site</title>
    <script src="arrays-08.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Nothing going on yet.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


## Exercise 1:

It is possible to inspect the inner properties of objects within an array to find a specific value. In this case, we are going to find a playlist by name.

```javascript
const playlist = playlistCollection.find(playlist => {
  return playlist.title === "Beethoven Concertos";
});

console.log(playlist.title);
```

The `find` method will return the first object that matches the condition. In this case, the object with the title "Beethoven Concertos", this is denoted by `playlist.title`;


We could also use the arrow function in a shorter form:

```javascript
const playlist = playlistCollection.find(playlist => playlist.title === "Beethoven Concertos");

console.log(playlist.title);
```


# Exercise 2:

Find all the playlists that have exactly 3 songs.

```javascript
const twoSongs = playlistCollection.filter(playlist => playlist.songs.length === 3);

console.log(twoSongs);
```

The `filter` method will return an array of objects that match the condition. In this case, the objects with exactly 3 songs. The result will be an array of objects, in this case, the playlists with the title "Beethoven Sonatas" and "Beethoven Concertos".

#  Exercise 3:

We can also use `map` to extract the songs and the `flat` method to flatten the array.

```javascript
const songs = playlistCollection.map(playlist => playlist.songs);

//returns an array of arrays that looks like this:
// [ [ { id: '04', title: 'Piano Sonata No. 3', artist: 'Beethoven' },
//     { id: '05', title: 'Piano Sonata No. 7', artist: 'Beethoven' },
//     { id: '06', title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10', artist: 'Beethoven' } ],
//   [ { id: '07', title: 'Piano Concerto No. 0', artist: 'Beethoven' },
//     { id: '08', title: 'Piano Concerto No. 4', artist: 'Beethoven' },
//     { id: '09', title: 'Piano Concerto No. 6', artist: 'Beethoven' } ],
//   [ { id: '10',
//     title: 'Opus 34: Six variations on a theme in F major',
//     artist: 'Beethoven' },
//     { id: '11',
//     title: 'Opus 120: Thirty-three variations on a waltz by Diabelli in C majo',
//     artist: 'Beethoven' } ] ]

// or in shorter version [ [Array 1], [Array 2], [Array 3] ]

const flatSongs = songs.flat();

console.log(flatSongs);
```

The `map` method will return an array of arrays, in this case, an array of songs for each playlist. The `flat` method will flatten the array of arrays into a single array of songs.

See the [flat documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat)

# Exercise 4:

For the following array, find the people that are over 20 years old (use filter)

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 17 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 30 },
  { name: "David", age: 20 }
];
```

For the following array, find the first person to score over 50 points.

```javascript
const scores = [
  { name: "Alice", score: 45 },
  { name: "Bob", score: 60 },
  { name: "Charlie", score: 30 },
  { name: "David", score: 55 }
];
```

For the following array, find the person who has a kid with the name "Sean".

```javascript
const families = [
  { name: "Alice", kids: ["Bob", "Charlie"] },
  { name: "David", kids: ["Sean", "Eve"] }
];
```
