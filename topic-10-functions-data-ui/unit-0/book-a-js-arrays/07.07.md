# Functions and Arrays

Now we are going to look at how we can use functions with arrays.  We will look at the `find`,`filter` and `map` methods.

# Exercises

For these exercises, create:

- arrays-07.html
- arrays-07.js

Use this contents for the html file:

## arrays-07.html

```html
<html> 
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Test Site</title>
    <script src="arrays-07.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Nothing going on yet.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Exercise 1:

Taking a simpler data set first, let's use a numbers array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9];
```

Using the find method, find the first number that is greater than 5.

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.find(number => number > 5);

console.log(greaterThanFive);
```

You should see the number 6 in the console.

If we write this in a longer form, it might be more understandable:

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.find(function(number) {
  return number > 5;
});
```

And in the longer form arrow function:

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.find((number) => {
  return number > 5;
});
```

Dissecting the above, the arrow function is:

```javascript
(number) => {
  return number > 5;
}
```

Where number is the input parameter, and the return value is the condition that is being tested, as such it will be either true or false.  The find method will look for the first element that returns true and return that value.

If we wanted to find the first number that is less than 5, we could use the find method in the same way:

```javascript
const lessThanFive = numbers.find(number => number < 5);
```

write this in a longer form:

```javascript
const lessThanFive = numbers.find(function(number) {
  return number < 5;
});
```

And in the longer form arrow function:

```javascript
const lessThanFive = numbers.find((number) => {
  return number < 5;
});
```

We are going to use the arrow functions in these array methods are they are not only more concise but they are also more suitable as iterators due to their implicit return and how they handle the `this` keyword (don't worry too much about understanding this now, the important part is the syntax).

## Exercise 2:

Using the same numbers array, let's use the filter method to find all the numbers that are greater than 5.

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.filter(number => number > 5);

console.log(greaterThanFive);
```

You should see the numbers 6, 7, and 9 in the console and you should also note that this returns an array of values.

To view the items of the array, you can use the forEach method:

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.filter(number => number > 5);

greaterThanFive.forEach(number => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

Or to write the above in the longer form with arrow functions:

```javascript
const greaterThanFive = numbers.filter((number) => {
  return number > 5;
});

greaterThanFive.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

`filter` and `find`` are very similar, the main difference is that `filter` will return an array of all the elements that return true, whereas `find` will return the first element that returns true.

## Exercise 3:

Another method that is very useful is the `map` method.  This method will return a new array with the results of the function that is passed to it.

Using the same numbers array, let's use the map method to double all the numbers in the array.

```javascript
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers);
```

You should see the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18 in the console and note that this returns an array of values.

To view the items of the array, you can use the forEach method:

```javascript
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

doubledNumbers.forEach(number => {
  console.log(number);
});
```


Or to write the above in the longer form with arrow functions:

```javascript
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

doubledNumbers.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
```
