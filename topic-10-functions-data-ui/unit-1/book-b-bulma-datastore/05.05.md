# Introduce a Data Store

Now that we have extracted our HTML creation into a separate file, we should consider doing the same for our data.  This will allow us to easily change the data source in the future and also remove hardcoded data from our view, or, `index.html`.  Let's create a new file in the `js` folder called `data-store.js`.  Add the following code to `data-store.js`.

```javascript
const dataStore = {
    data: [
        {
            name: "Chill",
            description: "A playlist to chill to",
            imageUrl: "https://source.unsplash.com/person-holding-coffee-mug-cspncX4cUnQ"
        },
        {
            name: "Focus",
            description: "A playlist to focus to",
            imageUrl: "https://source.unsplash.com/person-holding-camera-lens-7KLa-xLbSXA"
        },
        {
            name: "Let Off Steam",
            description: "A playlist for one of those days",
            imageUrl: "https://source.unsplash.com/black-and-white-electric-guitar-TW-wknV1oZo"
        },
        {
            name: "Rock",
            description: "Rock your socks",
            imageUrl: "https://source.unsplash.com/grayscale-photo-of-person-in-hoodie-top-watching-a-concert-97p-JwqdyW4"
        }
    ],
    list(){
        return this.data
    },
}
```

We have created a `dataStore` object that contains an array of objects.  We have also added a `list` method that returns the `data` array.  The list method uses the method shorthand syntax.

This is a new feature in [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_version_history) (a JavaScript version) that allows us to omit the colon and function keyword when defining methods in an object.  This is a nice shorthand that makes our code cleaner and easier to read.

Now let's update our HTML `index.html` to use the `dataStore` object.

First import the script

```html
  <script src="js/bulma.js"></script>
  <script src="js/components/playlist-item.js"></script>
  <script src="js/data-store.js"></script>
```

Next remove the hardcoded playlist array and loop over the `dataStore` data using the `list()` method.

```html
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const main = document.querySelector('main');
      dataStore.list().forEach((playlist) => {
        main.innerHTML = main.innerHTML + createPlaylistItem(playlist);
      });
    });
  </script>
```

Now when you refresh the page, you should see the same playlists as before.  The difference is that the data is now coming from the `dataStore` object.

This is a good practice as it separates our data from our view and makes it easier to change the data source in the future (say to be a HTTP API you create in Web Development 2, spoilers!).
