# Refactor

Alright, we are reasonably happy and push this up for code review.

The senior engineer responds with the following feedback.

```plaintext
Hey, this is looking good.  
The only thing I am worried about is if we need to add more components other than a playlist component to this page.
Can you first refactor this so that the html creation for the playlist is in it's own file.
Then we can add more components as needed.
```

Alrighty, let's refactor this.

Let's do as the senior engineer suggest and refactor the code so that the playlist creation is in its own file.

In the js folder, create a new folder called `components`.  Inside of the `components` folder, create a new file called `playlist-item.js`.

Add the following code to `playlist-item.js`.

```javascript
const createPlaylistItem = (playlist) => {
    return `
    <div class="column is-4">
      <section class="card has-text-centered">
        <header class="card-header">
          <p class="card-header-title is-size-4 is-centered">
            ${playlist.name}
          </p>
        </header>
        <div class="card-image">
          <figure class="image">
            <img src="${playlist.imageUrl}" alt="Image">
          </figure>
        </div>
        <article class="card-content">
          <p class="content is-size-4">
            ${playlist.description}
          </p>
        </article>
        <footer class="card-footer">
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Play</button>
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Open</button>
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Remove</button>
        </footer>
      </section>
    </div>`
}
```

Next augment index.html to include the new file. 

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Dotify - Your.Music</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/images/favicon.png" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css" />
  <script src="js/bulma.js"></script>
  <script src="js/components/playlist-item.js"></script>
```

Now, let's refactor the code in `index.html` to use the new function.  Our `forEach` can now be changed to:

```javascript
playlists.forEach((playlist) => {
  main.innerHTML = main.innerHTML + createPlaylistItem(playlist);
});
```

Refresh your page and make sure everything is still working as expected.

OK, what have we done here?  

We have taken the code that creates the playlist item and moved it to its own file.  This will make it easier to add more components in the future.  We have also updated the `index.html` file to include the new file and updated the `index.html` file to use the new function.  This is a good example of refactoring code to make it more maintainable and easier to work with in the future.

Examining the `playlist-item.js` file we can see:

```javascript
const createPlaylistItem = (playlist) => {
    return `
    <div class="column is-4">
      <section class="card has-text-centered">
        <header class="card-header">
          <p class="card-header-title is-size-4 is-centered">
            ${playlist.name}
          </p>
        </header>
        <div class="card-image">
          <figure class="image">
            <img src="${playlist.imageUrl}" alt="Image">
          </figure>
        </div>
        <article class="card-content">
          <p class="content is-size-4">
            ${playlist.description}
          </p>
        </article>
        <footer class="card-footer">
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Play</button>
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Open</button>
          <button class="card-footer-item button has-background-grey-lighter">Remove</button>
        </footer>
      </section>
    </div>`
}
```

Here we declare a function that is made available to our page called `createPlaylistItem`.  This function takes a playlist object as an argument and returns a string that represents the HTML for a playlist item.

This is a good example of how we can _encapsulate_ functionality into a function and make it reusable.

Note that we can further optimize the code where we augment the DOM.  So,

```javascript
const main = document.querySelector('main');
playlists.forEach((playlist, index) => {
  main.innerHTML = main.innerHTML + element;
});
```
Can become:

```javascript
const main = document.querySelector('main');
playlists.forEach((playlist) => main.innerHTML += createPlaylistItem(playlist));
```
Try it out.  This syntax can be mind-bending at first, but it is a common pattern in JavaScript.  It is a good idea to get used to it.

We've basically created a single line arrow function by relying on the `+=` operator to append and modify the `innerHTML` property of the `main` element.

For now, we will leave the code as is before the change as it is quite readable and easy to understand.  We will leave the optimization for later but if you are feeling up to trying to understand it, go for it.

Your entire HTML should be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="has-background-black" lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css" />
  <script src="js/bulma.js"></script>
  <script src="js/components/playlist-item.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const playlists = [
        {
          name: "Chill",
          description: "A playlist to chill to",
          imageUrl: "https://source.unsplash.com/person-holding-coffee-mug-cspncX4cUnQ"

        }
      ];

      const main = document.querySelector('main');
      playlists.forEach((playlist) => {
        main.innerHTML = main.innerHTML + createPlaylistItem(playlist);
      });
    });
