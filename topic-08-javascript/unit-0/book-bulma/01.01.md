# Brief

You have been asked to develop a music and playlist manager for popular music streaming service, `Dotify`.

The application should allow users to manage playlists, view their favourite artists, songs and albums.

You have been asked to prove you can do with with a simple prototype with the following features:

* A homepage that shows a list of playlists
* A user should be able to play, open or remove playlists
* A user should be able to view a menu to select
  * Home
  * Playlists
  * Artists
  * Songs
  * About

The buttons and links do not need to work, but should be styled and positioned correctly.

The style of the website should be based on the Dotify branding.

A multi-million dollar contract is on the line. Don't mess this up.
