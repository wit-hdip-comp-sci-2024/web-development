# variables

Run the following code in the console:

```javascript
const numberOfCards = document.querySelectorAll('.card').length;
```

Now just type `numberOfCards` and press enter.  What is the value of `numberOfCards`?

Now attempt to change the value of `numberOfCards` by typing the following and pressing enter:

```javascript
numberOfCards = 5;
```

What happens?  Why?

You should see an error message that says "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."

Now refresh the page and run the following code in the console:

```javascript
let numberOfCards = document.querySelectorAll('.card').length;
```

Now just type `numberOfCards` and press enter.  What is the value of `numberOfCards`?

Now attempt to change the value of `numberOfCards` by typing the following and pressing enter:

```javascript
numberOfCards = 5;
```

What happens?  Why?

You should see that the value of `numberOfCards` is now 5.  This is because `let` is a variable that can be reassigned.

What does this tell you about the difference between `const` and `let`?
