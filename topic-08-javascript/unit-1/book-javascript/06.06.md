# Wrap Up

This lab has given you exposure to the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript.  You have learned how to select elements using `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`, and how to manipulate the elements using JavaScript.  You have also learned about the difference between `const` and `let` in JavaScript.

These are the building blocks of web development.  You will use these skills to build web applications and websites so be sure to understand as the pace will increase from the next lecture and lab.
