# Menus

The Bulma **navbar** component is a responsive horizontal **navbar** that can support images, links, buttons, and dropdowns.

- <https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/>

Bulma also allows for navigation elements to be integrated into the Hero Banner, we are going to use this option. To do this we will move the navigation from the **layout.njk** to the Hero Banner in **header.njk**. We will use the sample navigation in `hero-foot`  as our guide

<https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/hero/#fullheight-hero-in-3-parts>

Firstly, we are going to delete the nav include in **layout.njk** before including it in **header.njk**, our content section will now look like this

#### layout.njk
~~~html
<section class="column is-three-quarters">          
  {{ content | safe }}
</section>
~~~

We will then add a new div with a class of `hero-foot`. Our nav.njk include will be inside this div. The full file will look like this:

#### header.njk
~~~html
<header class="columns">
  <div class="column is-full">
    <section class="hero is-info is-small">
      <div class="hero-body">
        <p class="title">
          Welcome to the App Bundle Store
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          The best App store on the internet
        </p>
      </div>      
      <div class="hero-foot">
        {% include "nav.njk" %}
      </div>
    </section>
  </div>
</header>
~~~

Here is a revised version of **nav.njk** which uses this feature:

## nav.njk

~~~html
<nav class="tabs is-boxed is-three-quarters">
{% set navPages = collections.all | eleventyNavigation %}

  <div class="container">
    <ul>
      {%- for entry in navPages %}      	
          <li {% if entry.url == page.url %} class="is-active" {% endif %} > 
            <a href="{{ entry.url | url }}"> {{ entry.title }}</a>
          </li> 
      {%- endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>

~~~

Note, as per the `hero-foot` nav example in the Bulma documentation we have changed the classes on the **nav** element. We have introduced a **div** element with a class `container`. We have also changed the active class on the list item to Bulma's `is-active`.

The navigation should work as before.

The navbar menu might be worth exploring in more detail:
