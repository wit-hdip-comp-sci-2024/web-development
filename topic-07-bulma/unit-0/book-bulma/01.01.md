# Include CSS Framework

This assumes you have completed lab 06b:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2022/bundle-store/releases/tag/lab06.end>

You can use your solution, or download the version above.

Note that if you download the version be sure to copy the `.eleventy.js` file as your operating system may hide files that start with a dot.

Secondly, be sure to run `npm install` (or `npm i` for short) to install the dependencies. (We haven't covered `npm` yet so don't worry if you can't remember doing this.)

### layout.njk

The first step is replace the style sheet we have developed with the include of a CSS framework 

~~~html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css">
~~~

This is the complete page:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <main class="container">
      {% include "header.njk" %}
      <section id="maincontent">
        <section id="primary">
          {% include "nav.njk" %}
          {{ content | safe }}
        </section>
        <aside id="secondary">
          {% include "sidebar.njk" %}
        </aside>
      </section>
      {% include "footer.njk" %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

As we are no longer using our own style sheet, we can simplify our html by removing all 'id=' and 'class=' attributes in our sources:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <main>
      {% include "header.njk" %}
      <section>
        <section>
          {% include "nav.njk" %}      
          {{ content | safe }}
        </section>
        <aside>
          {% include "sidebar.njk" %}
        </aside>
      </section>
      {% include "footer.njk" %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Now we can run the app. Remember you must start the Eleventy server:

~~~bash
$ eleventy --serve
~~~

And you must run the above command from within the project folder.

Having removed our own style sheet, the index page looks like this:

It is back to being unstyled again.
