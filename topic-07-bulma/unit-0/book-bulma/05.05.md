# Content and Box

Bulma CSS Framework has default styles that can be applied to content areas. `content` applies formatting to several text elements while `box` separates content areas visually.

### Content Areas
Now that we have arranged our Hero and Footer, we will update our content areas for each of our three pages.

When you can't use the CSS classes you want, or when you just want to directly use HTML tags, use `content` as container. It can handle almost any HTML tag:

*   `<p>` paragraphs
*   `<ul>` `<ol>` `<dl>` lists
*   `<h1>` to `<h6>` headings
*   `<blockquote>` quotes
*   `<em>` and `<strong>`
*   `<table>` `<tr>` `<th>` `<td>` tables

This `content` class can be used in _any_ context where you just want to (or can only) write some **text**. 

#### index.njk

~~~html
...
<article class="content">
...
~~~

This adds padding and line-height to the above elements on the page

### Box

The `box` element is a simple container with a white background, some padding, and a box shadow. Add the `box` class to article elements on each of your pages. 

#### index.njk

~~~html
...
<article class="content box">
...
~~~


#### sidebar.njk

Repeat these steps for the sidebar.njk to add `content` and `box` classes to the *aside* element.

~~~html
...
<aside class="content box">
...
~~~
