# Partials

Create a new folder in the project called **_includes** and create 2 new files in here:

### header.njk

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>Welcome to the App Bundle Store</h1>
</div>
```

### footer.njk

```html
<div id="footer">
  <p>Contact us at : bundle@store.com, or visit us: <a href="directions.html"> directions </a></p>
</div>
```

The project structure now looks like this:

```bash
 └── bundle-store
      ├── _includes
      │   ├── footer.njk
      │   └── header.njk
      ├── apps.njk
      ├── css
      │   ├── grid.css
      │   ├── home.css
      │   ├── image.css
      │   └── nav.css
      ├── directions.njk
      ├── images
      │   ├── background.gif
      │   ├── banner.png
      │   ├── business.png
      │   ├── insanity.jpg
      │   ├── ondesoft.jpg
      │   └── ultimate.jpeg
      └── index.njk
```

Now edit each of the apps, index and directions files - replacing the header + footer in each of those files with these statements:

```html
...
     {% include "header.njk" %}
... 
     {% include "footer.njk" %}
...
```

So, for instance the **directions.njk** file will now look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/home.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <div class="container">
      {% include "header.njk" %}
      <div id="navigation">
        <ul id="menu">
          <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/apps">Apps</a></li>
          <li class="active"><a href="/directions">Directions</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="maincontent">
        <div id="primary">
          <h1>Directions</h1>
          <h2>Our store is located :</h2>
          <p>
            Take the M9 / N9 towards Waterford. At the first roundabout on approach to Waterford,
            take the first exit (signposted Waterford / Cork / Rosslare). At the next roundabout,
            take the third exit (signposted N25 / Cork / Waterford South). Proceed through the toll
            bridge (toll is €1.90 per car). Take the exit directly after the toll bridge (signposted
            Waterford South/R710). </p>
          <p>
            At the top of the off-ramp, go left at the small roundabout, then straight through two
            larger roundabouts (signposted R710/City Centre/Tramore). At the next roundabout (
            retail park on your left), take the first exit (signposted City Centre). Proceed down
            the Cork Road for approx 2km and the main entrance to WIT’s main campus is on the left.
            The College Street Campus is a further 2km towards the city centre on the left. </p>
          <hr>
        </div>
      </div>
      {% include "footer.njk" %}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Make sure you have made this change to all files - and now browse to the site:

- <http://localhost:8080/>

Even though we are starting to radically alter the structure of the site, the site is still served exactly as it was before.

This is the power of templates, we can start to break up a site into reusable parts (partials) and have the site dynamically assembled by the server.

Up until this point, copy and pasting has been breaking my developer heart.
