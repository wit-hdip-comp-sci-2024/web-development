### Solution

The project developed in this lab:

### Exercises

### 1

See if you can convert one of your other projects to Eleventy, and deploy using Netlify.  Perhaps the 'bundle store' project from lab03a. The instructions on steps 05, 06 and 07 from this lab should be all you need to do this task.

### 2

Notice that when using eleventy locally and serving via `eleventy --serve` that saving your files will automatically update the site in your browser, without the need to refresh.  This is a feature of Eleventy.  

However, when deploying to Netlify, you will need to push your changes to Netlify manually for now.
