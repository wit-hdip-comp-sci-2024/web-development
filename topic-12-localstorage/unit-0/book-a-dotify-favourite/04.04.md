# The End

To get the source of this lab, get it [here](./archives/js-playlist-1.7.0.zip).

In dotify we have:

* Created a simple playlist listing page with bulma cards
* It is fully mobile responsive
* We fully drive our UI from our data store
* We can open the playlist to view songs
* We can mark playlists as favourites and save the state in local storage

It is definitely not feature complete but it is a good start. There's a lot of features to add, but for now, we are done.

Note that we are building components using HTML strings in our JavaScript.  This is typically a bad idea in a production application and is usually better to build elements using the DOM API.

We chose this way as it illustrates how we can build components in a simple way.  Without getting frameworks and libraries involved.  When you move to future modules, you will likely use React to build components, that is what this application is based on but a very much DIY approach.  Hopefully it will help you when you hit React in future.

In Web Dev 2, we will move all our data to a server and build a full stack application.  We will also complete the MVC pattern by adding a controller to our application.
